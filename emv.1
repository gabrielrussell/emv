.TH EMV 1 "August 2025" "emv 1.0" "User Commands"
.SH NAME
emv \- rename multiple files in a directory all at once with a text editor

.SH SYNOPSIS
.B emv
.RI [ directory ]

.SH DESCRIPTION
.B emv
(edit move) is a utility that allows you to rename multiple filesystem objects (files, directories, symbolic links, etc.) by editing their names in your preferred text editor. It presents a list of names in a temporary file, opens your editor to modify the list, and then performs the necessary rename operations to match your edits.

.P
The program tries to handle complex rename scenarios including file swapping (A→B, B→A) by using temporary storage when necessary. It tries to validate all rename operations before executing them to try to prevent data loss.

.SH USAGE
When run,
.B emv
will:
.IP 1. 4
Scan the current directory (or specified directory) for filesystem objects
.IP 2. 4
Create a temporary file listing all names (excluding hidden entries)
.IP 3. 4
Open the file in your text editor ($EDITOR environment variable)
.IP 4. 4
After you save and exit the editor, analyze the changes
.IP 5. 4
Perform the rename operations to match your edited list

.SH ARGUMENTS
.TP
.I directory
Optional directory to operate in. If not specified, operates in the current directory.

.SH ENVIRONMENT
.TP
.B EDITOR
The text editor to use for editing the file list. This environment variable must be set. Common values include "vim", "emacs", "nano", or "code".

.SH EXAMPLES
.TP
.B emv
Rename files and directories in the current directory
.TP
.B emv /path/to/photos
Rename files and directories in the /path/to/photos directory
.TP
.B EDITOR=nano emv
Use nano as the editor for this session

.SH EDITING THE FILE LIST
When your editor opens, you'll see a list of names, one per line:
.IP
.nf
photo001.jpg
photo002.jpg
vacation.txt
.fi
.P
You can edit this list to rename the objects:
.IP
.nf
hawaii_beach.jpg
hawaii_sunset.jpg
vacation_notes.txt
.fi
.P
When you save and exit, they will be renamed accordingly.

.SH RENAME RULES
.TP
.B Entry count must remain the same
You cannot add or remove lines from the list. The number of entries must remain constant.
.TP
.B No duplicate names
You cannot rename multiple entries to the same name.
.TP
.B No overwriting unchanged entries
You cannot rename an entry to the name of an existing entry that you didn't also rename.
.TP
.B Complex renames are supported
Entry swapping (A→B, B→A) and circular renames are automatically handled using temporary storage.
